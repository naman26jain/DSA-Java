BRIAN KARNIGHAN ALGORITHM to calculate number of set bits in and integer

in this start from the right most bits, as soon as the counter encounters the set bit in increaments the counter by one and toggles the set bit to unset bit.


algo:
 while(num>0){
        num=(num&(num-1));
        count++;
 }

 Time complexity =O(no.setBits)
